Overview Of The Project 
The Student Grades Management System is a Java-based application designed to help users (teachers, students, or administrators) input, calculate, and manage grades for individual students across different subjects or assignments. The system is structured to provide insights such as the average grade, overall performance, and corresponding letter grade or GPA.

Core Functionalities
Grade Input

Users can input grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
Grades can be entered in percentage or numeric form (e.g., out of 100).
Grade Calculation

Computes the average grade across all entered subjects or assignments.
Maps numeric averages to corresponding letter grades or GPA.
Performance Summary

Displays a summary that includes:
Individual grades for each subject or assignment.
Average grade (percentage or numeric).
Letter grade or GPA.
Data Management

Allows users to add, update, or remove grades as needed.
Grade Scale Customization

Users can configure the grade scale for letter grades (e.g., A = 90–100, B = 80–89).
Technical Details
Programming Language

Implemented in Java.
Data Storage

Grades are stored in memory using Java collections like ArrayList or HashMap.
Can be extended to use file storage (e.g., CSV) or databases (e.g., SQLite) for persistence.
Architecture

Modular Design: Separation of logic into distinct classes such as Student, Grade, and GradeManager.
Object-Oriented Principles: Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Scalability

Supports multiple students (optional for future expansion).
Can handle an arbitrary number of subjects or assignments.
Project Structure
Models

Student: Represents a student with attributes like Name and ID.
Grade: Represents grades for specific subjects or assignments.
Services

GradeManager: Handles grade input, calculation, and display.
GradeCalculator: Performs calculations for average grades, letter grades, and GPA.
Utilities

InputValidator: Validates user inputs for grades and subjects.
GradeScale: Defines the numeric range for letter grades or GPA mappings.
Main Application

GradesApp: Contains the main method and user interface logic (console-based).
User Interaction Flow
Main Menu

Options:
1. Input Grades
2. View Grades
3. Update Grades
4. Delete Grades
5. Calculate Average and View Performance
6. Exit
Input Grades

Users enter grades for subjects or assignments.
Option to review and confirm the input.
View or Update Grades

Displays all grades with subject/assignment names.
Allows users to modify specific entries.
Calculate and Display Performance

Displays:
Average grade.
Letter grade (based on a grade scale).
GPA (if applicable).
Exit

Closes the program securely.
Future Enhancements
Support for Multiple Students: Manage grades for an entire class.
Graphical Interface: GUI for better usability.
Export and Import: Save grades to a file (e.g., CSV) or database.
Advanced Reporting: Generate performance reports and statistics.
